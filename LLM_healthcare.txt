            "output": "Well, based on what you're telling me, it sounds like you may be suffering from panic disorder. The best course of action is to start with psychotherapy and mental health counseling. Additionally, we should conduct an electrocardiogram to make sure that there are no physical issues causing your panic attacks. We will also need to perform a depression screen and a toxicology screen to rule out any other underlying causes. Finally, I would recommend a comprehensive psychological and psychiatric evaluation and therapy to help manage your symptoms."

            "output": "It's possible that you have a vocal cord polyp. To confirm this, we need to conduct tracheoscopy and laryngoscopy with a biopsy. We may also need to conduct an occupational therapy assessment such as speech therapy, other diagnostic procedures like an interview or consultation, physical therapy exercises, as well as diagnostic procedures on your nose, mouth, and pharynx to rule out any other underlying conditions. Additionally, we may need to evaluate your eyes and ears for any related conditions, such as ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment."
